# INN Experience

## Introduction

INN Experience is an initiative which aims to encourage conversations among Learning and Development Officers in the Civil Service College (CSC), Prime Minister's Office (PMO). INN Experience is a collaboration between the Institute of Public Administration and Management (IPAM) and the Learning Futures Group (LFG) that started in 2019. 

During the third installment of INN Experience, Learning and Development Officers participated in a hackaton which required them to explore a set of data which compared the learning effectiveness of the same programme conducted at two different locations. In preparation for this installment, I was responsible for the following:

1. Clean the data;
2. Describe the data;
3. Conduct a mediation analysis; and
4. Visualise the data.

## Folder Structure
